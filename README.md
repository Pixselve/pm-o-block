### Are you thinking : 'Whoah, this bot is perfect for my server ! But is my guild good enough for this bot ?' ?

- If it's 'yes', take a look at this [bot invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=591947906664235008&scope=bot&permissions=8) and take care of our bot...

- If it's 'no', ask you again this question because ALL OF THE DISCORD SERVERS ARE GREAT ! Uh, Fortnite servers still exist today ? I didn't know that...
